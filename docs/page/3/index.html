<p>Since I was tired of using the <a href="http://thesignalpath.com/blogs/2011/06/12/camera-flash-circuit-and-nixie-tube-tutorial/" target="_blank">flash circuit hack</a> (<a href="https://plus.google.com/+NathanCampos/posts/f2zAfrbQJmw" target="_blank">my version</a>) to power my tube experiments I finally decided to build a isolation transformer using two identical step-down transformers as suggested by Mike in his <a href="http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/nixclock.html" target="_blank">nixie clock documentation</a>. Here are some photos of it:</p>

<h2><a href="/post/2014-05-16/Generic-Chinese-MP3-Player-Teardown/">Generic Chinese MP3 Player Teardown</a></h2>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve described in <a href="/post/2014-05-11/Unbelievable_Prices.html" target="_blank">Unbelievable Prices</a>, I bought a crappy chinese MP3 player to use as a &ldquo;true&rdquo; sound source (instead of the function generator I use while early-testing my audio projects) for testing my audio circuits without having to worry about accidentally shorting 12V into my iPod&rsquo;s headphone jack or something like that while probing around.</p>
<p>Yesterday it arrived and as it was expected, it&rsquo;s the best of Shenzhen. Horrible plastics and build quality, the buttons are super stiff, and overall a shitty product as it was expected to be, but since I&rsquo;m only going to use it for testing, I don&rsquo;t care. Here are some pictures of the &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; thing:

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s a typical chinese product. The LiPo battery has no markings, except for a weird XI logo, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a protected pack and the flimsy wires that connect it to the main board can snap off at any second and short the thing out.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Board view" src="/img/crappy-mp3-player/board-view.jpg"/></p>
<p>Right next to what looks like the main processor, which sadly I couldn&rsquo;t find any information about it, there&rsquo;s a very nicely heat-shrunk clock crystal. On the center of the board you can see a generic <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm4871.pdf" target="_blank">4871</a> audio power amplifier, and on the left side there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.kingroad-china.net/Uploadfiles/2010763471154996.pdf" target="_blank">BK1080</a> FM receiver IC.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Top board view" src="/img/crappy-mp3-player/top-board.jpg"/></p>
<p>On the other side of the board all you can see is the horrible LCD and the shittiest buttons you can buy in the Shenzhen market. </p>

<h2><a href="/post/2014-05-14/Lightwave-AM-Transmitter-Receiver/">Lightwave AM Transmitter/Receiver</a></h2>
<nav>Nathan Campos - Wed 14 May 2014</nav>
<div class="article-body"><meta name="title" content="Lightwave AM Transmitter/Receiver">
<meta name="author" content="Nathan Campos">

<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with a very simple and cheap project for wireless transmissions, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank">lightwave</a> AM transmitter and receiver based on <a href="http://www.cheapscience.com/2012/03/voice-led-modulator.html" target="_blank">Scott&rsquo;s design</a>, which was based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvF77YdkzcY" target="_blank">VK2ZAY&rsquo;s design</a>. In my final design I&rsquo;ve increased the base biasing resistors to decrease the size of the coupling capacitor and also used a darlington transistor to get more current gain.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Schematic" src="/img/photonic/basic-schematic.png"/></p>
<p>The transmitter is pretty straight forward, the input modulates the current passing by the LED, which modulates the intensity of light, if you&rsquo;ve designed any class A amplifiers in the past you surely know how it works. The receiver is just a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transimpedance_amplifier" target="_blank">transimpedance amplifier</a>, which is amplifying the signal quite a bit (~56x gain) since the transmitter will usually be a bit far from the receiver. You can do the same with a op-amp, but I much prefer a discrete circuit for these simple things.</p>
<p>You can put a buffer stage with a darlington <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_collector" target="_blank">emitter follower</a> on the output of the receiver so you can drive a speaker directly. Something that I would recommend is to add a small (10x gain maybe?) pre-amplifier for the transmitter, that way you&rsquo;ll get a bit more signal if you&rsquo;re source isn&rsquo;t very loud, specially if you want to drive some high power LEDs, since you have a lot of current headroom with those.</p>
<p>If you want to experiment with different values in a simulation, here is the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12174296/Current%20Flow/AM%20Lightwave%20Transmitter%20and%20Receiver.asc" target="_blank">LTspice schematic</a>. The best way to choose the best LED + photodiode combination to maximize the range is to build some breakout boards that you can plug different LEDs and photodiodes until you have the perfect combination.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m building a bunch of audio circuits lately and I usually have to test them using a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; sound source (after extensively testing it with my function generator), I decided I should buy the cheapest chinese crap MP3 player just to protect my phone or any audio source that I&rsquo;m using. The last thing I want is to short something or accidentally apply a (relatively) high voltage to one of the audio pins, or do anything that could damage my device.</p>
<p>So, I quickly went to <a href="http://mercadolivre.com.br/" target="_blank">MercadoLivre</a>, the brazilian version of eBay, and searched for the cheapest ($3 multimeter quality) MP3 player available, and sure enough, <a href="http://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-554445523-mini-mp3-playerfm-shuflle-clipentrada-microsd-suporta-32gb-_JM" target="_blank">this popped up</a>. It always amazed me how cheap they can produce this sort of crap, but seriously, $6.31 with taxes and all for a device with a shitty color display and all? That&rsquo;s just insane, they are probably assembling millions of those to be able to produce them at that price.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, I&rsquo;ve bought this piece of junk which will happily suit my needs, since it&rsquo;s so fucking cheap that it can be considered disposable. </p>
