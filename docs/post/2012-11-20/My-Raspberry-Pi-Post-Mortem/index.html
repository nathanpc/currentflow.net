<p>This might be the worst day of this current year. As you might already know yesterday, after 4 months of agony, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/SOj3MIlsH2/" target="_blank">I finally received my Raspberry Pi</a>. It cheered me up a lot, since in the same day my old Galaxy S bricked. Today the perfect chemical reaction occurred. All the excitement and expectation converted entirely (maybe multiplied) into a strange mix of frustration, sadness, and anger. My Raspberry Pi arrived dead.</p>
<p>After 4 long months of wait, ~20 items on a TODO list, 3 projects, 2 VMs, ~50 tweets, and 3 articles, it all came to a sad end. Today my friend borrowed me his spare USB keyboard so I could turn ON an configure my Raspberry Pi for the first time. While it was booting I had one of the most awesome experiences ever: I&rsquo;ve watched the original Linux boot, with a logo on the left corner and all those awesome lines blazing through the screen, just like in 2005 when I booted Linux for the first time on my extremely old IBM ThinkPad. After I saw those lines for the first time I decided I wanted to know more about how things were made, Linux got me into programming, and turned me into what I am today. It was a awesome moment to watch those lines again.</p>
<p>The first thing <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/" target="_blank">Raspbian</a> did was show me a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses" target="_blank">ncurses</a>-based configuration tool. I started configuring it and suddenly &ldquo;No Signal&rdquo;. I looked at the Raspberry Pi and the only thing that showed me it was working was the Power LED, all the other LEDs (including the internet ones) turned OFF. I disconnected the power and tried booting it up again. This time it did the same thing, but a lot earlier.</p>
<p>I rushed to my computer to check if it was a known issue and if someone had a fix, many users had similar issues, but not the same, the suggestions were the same: Check the power source voltage and the SD Card. I&rsquo;ve started by downloading the other distros and flashing them on different cards, without success on the Pi, I was still having the strange issue. Then I decided to get a multimeter to check the voltage of the board, when I checked the board voltage it was great, so it means it wasn&rsquo;t the power source causing the issue. All I got was to acknowledge that I got a faulty unit.</p>
<p>I inserted the Raspberry Pi back into its case and gently stored it into the drawer were I put all the electronics that stopped working, which currently contains only my first laptop (that ThinkPad with Linux) and my Galaxy S. I care a lot about all my electronics, even after they are &ldquo;dead&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s why I never sold, or trashed any of them, which means I almost have a museum here in my room, with all the devices I ever owned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to know what will be the next thing that will get me as excited as the Raspberry Pi did. Computers, they aren&rsquo;t fun to play with anymore, and the Raspberry Pi changed this. The mobile world that always excited me, since the day I got my Palm, is no longer that exciting. So what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be buying another Raspberry Pi, probably not. All the excitement extinguished today.</p>
