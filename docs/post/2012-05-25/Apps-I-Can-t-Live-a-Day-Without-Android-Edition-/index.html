<p>This is the first article of a series I&rsquo;ll be doing. Here I&rsquo;m going to list the apps I can&rsquo;t live a day without, in the various platforms I use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I decided to start with iOS, which is the one I like most in the phone category, that&rsquo;s why I always carry my iPhone with me: Apps. But then I choose to start with Android because in my opnion it&rsquo;s a more productivity OS, also I&rsquo;m &nbsp;writing this article on my Eee Pad Slider using Google Docs.</p>
<p>Let me begin by listing the Android devices I own and use every day:<ul><li>ASUS Eee Pad Slider<li>Samsung Galaxy Tab (the original 7&quot; version)<li>Samsung Galaxy S</ul></p>
<p>I also have a Motorola Milestone (aka OG Droid) which I only use to test the apps I develop for Android. So I think it doesn&rsquo;t count as one of my daily drivers. Now let&rsquo;s begin with the app list:</p>
<p><strong>Google Music</strong><br/>The best way to listen to my library whenever I go. It syncs my iTunes library with all my devices using the awesome Google cloud and albums that I like most and want to enjoy don&rsquo;t matter if I have a internet connection, with a single tap and they get downloaded to my device so can be played offline. With a stuning UI and great features it&rsquo;s by far the best music player for Android in my opinion. If you don&rsquo;t want the cloud features you can check out DoubleTwist which a great alternative for people that just want their music on the device.<br/><br/><strong>Gaug.es</strong><br/>In my opinion the best analytics service available. It&rsquo;s simpler than Google Analytics and everything happens in real-time. The app shows all the information you can have on the desktop version and also lets you have the awesome AirTraffic Live feature that shows you in real-time, on a map, the detailed traffic on your site. Since I love to check out every second how my sites are performing I can&rsquo;t live without it for a day.<br/><br/><strong>Wunderlist</strong><br/>This is just the best task manager app ever invented. With a set of apps for every platform you can imagine from desktops to mobile devices. I use it to manage all the tasks I have to finish regarding my projects and keep them all synced across my devices. Definetly a must-have app for people that must be productive.<br/><br/><strong>Google Docs</strong><br/>The most important app on my Eee Pad Slider. Everyone knows this app, if doesn&rsquo;t know at least the service you should know. I use it on a daily basis to write my articles and long texts for work or school. I stoped using any office suite, this includes iWork and Microsoft Office, after switching to Docs last year. Don&rsquo;t matter where I go I can view and edit any document I want.<br/><br/><strong>Read it Later</strong><br/>I choose it instead of Instapaper because of the official support for Android and iOS. I love this app because I can keep all the articles I want to read offline and synced. Really a must-have for people that like to read a lot of articles on a day.<br/><br/><br/>That&rsquo;s it, if you have any other app you think is awesome please share on the comments. </p>
