<p>I can still remember like it was yesterday, a time where paid applications never would cost less than $10. Today I can get on the App Store or the Play Store and download an fairly powerful app for no more than $3.99, but even at this prices I think twice before buying it. The App Store effect, as I like to call it, made the app consumer not want to pay more than $0.99 for a decent app, even if it&rsquo;s just $1.99 it might hesitate buying it.</p>
<p>I would comfortably pay more than $3.99 for a <strong>extremely</strong> well done, powerful and useful app. The problem is that those kind of applications aren&rsquo;t very common, but they are an expressive number, but I&rsquo;m not here to talk about the apps that deserve this price tag, this article is about apps that aren&rsquo;t deserving their price tag.</p>
<p>In my opinion the best way to actually charge for an app is by using the freemium model, that&rsquo;s why <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper" target="_blank">Paper</a> was such a success, you get the app for free and test it, if you like/need more features, in this case tools, you pay for them using in-app purchases, and if you want to unlock all the potential of the app you pay a discounted price for all the tools. This way the user can feel the app before buying it, which makes me hesitate when I need to buy the app without a way of testing it first.</p>
<p>On this model I&rsquo;ll start with an Android app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teragadgets.android.notes" target="_blank">Flick Notes</a>, if you&rsquo;re a heavily <a href="http://simplenote.com/" target="_blank">SimpleNote</a> user like me you might know this app. It&rsquo;s an awesome clean and simple app, the problem is that in order to unlock all the (missing) features of the app: Note and notes list widgets, To-Do list style notes, and remove ads, you must pay a extremely expensive <a href="http://simplenote.com/" target="_blank">CA$4.99 fee</a>. I think this is to much expensive just to get rid of ads, enable to-do lists, and have the widget of the app. I would comfortably pay $1.99 for those features, and I&rsquo;m sure the developer would earn a lot more money since a lot more people would buy the full version.</p>
<p>Another example of this, now on the desktop side, is a awesome new app for SimpleNote users that have a Mac OS computer, called <a href="http://www.metanota.com/" target="_blank">MetaNota</a>. It&rsquo;s a free, ad-supported app, but it&rsquo;s possible to remove it by paying a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metanota/id511648940" target="_blank">$9.99 fee</a>, yeah that&rsquo;s just to remove the ad.</p>
<p>These are just some small examples of what I&rsquo;m talking about. If you&rsquo;re a developer that is planing to monetize your app in some way I suggest you to do the freemium way, but don&rsquo;t forget: We are living the $0.99 era! </p>
