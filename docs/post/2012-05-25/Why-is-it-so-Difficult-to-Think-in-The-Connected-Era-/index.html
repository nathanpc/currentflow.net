<p>This week I woke up with a awesome idea: Almost an entire first chapter of a sci-fi book, so I decided that I should wrote this book. Also I always had this desire of writing an entire book that would include all my theories about the society.</p>
<p>A week passed and all my progress at the time is 2 pages (A4). What happened? It&rsquo;s difficult to have more ideas. On the era that we are connected 24/7 and work, studies and all our &ldquo;offline&rdquo; activities consume our time, minds and ideas, it&rsquo;s difficult to think since our minds and thoughts are occupied with other &ldquo;more important&rdquo; activities. That&rsquo;s why most of my great ideas and thoughts come to my mind while I&rsquo;m not connected or doing any other activity (not that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned &ldquo;worried&rdquo; about the activities), they usually come when I&rsquo;m going to sleep, taking a bath or on the car. A great example is this article itself, I thought and wrote it on the car.</p>
<p>So here is a tip to end this story: If you want to have more/better ideas all you have to do is go &ldquo;offline&rdquo; and try to distract yourself from any other activity that might keep you away of thinking. Listening to a so g you love is also a good idea to have ideas.</p>
<p>Do you have the same problem of having ideas because of all the activities and distractions of the connected era? I would love to hear your opinion. </p>
