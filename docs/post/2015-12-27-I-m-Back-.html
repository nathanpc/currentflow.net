<p>Sorry for this extremely long break, I&rsquo;ve been extremely busy with a bunch of stuff from university and wasn&rsquo;t feeling inspired to write any blog posts, but now I&rsquo;m hopefully back and I have a lot of plans for interesting future posts.</p>

<p>So, what happened in the entire year of silence? Well, first of all I got a girlfriend which is making me extremely happy and for the first time I&rsquo;ve been having the incredible experience of being in love.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="Me and my girlfriend in Foz do Igua&ccedil;u" src="http://i.imgur.com/8gCTfmj.jpg" /></p>

<p>Also this year I got overwhelmed by a shitton of university assignments and to top all that I&rsquo;ve been exposing my projects at a bunch of trade shows together with my friends. If you&rsquo;ve ever exposed things in trade shows you&rsquo;ll know that it&rsquo;s extremely stressing (before, during, and after) and time consuming, so I&rsquo;ve been putting a lot of effort into that. The last trade show I&rsquo;ve been to was called InnovaCities and it happened in Foz do Igua&ccedil;u, <a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/dir/Vitoria,+Vit%C3%B3ria+-+State+of+Esp%C3%ADrito+Santo/Foz+do+Igua%C3%A7u,+State+of+Paran%C3%A1/@-22.8712631,-51.9386506,6z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0xb83d5d85374ee9:0x97595e7ea70ed809!2m2!1d-40.2957768!2d-20.2976178!1m5!1m1!1s0x94f6983de5db79bb:0x920b68c585cac349!2m2!1d-54.5854238!2d-25.5162467!5i2?hl=en" target="_blank">pretty far from home</a>, and I had a great time there showing a much improved version of the <a href="http://nathancampos.me/post/85832773918/lightwave-am-transmitterreceiver" target="_blank">lightwave transmitter</a> and a automatic shower and sink that focuses on saving water which was a project I did with a friend that had the idea. We even had the pleasure of meeting some polish researchers and the prince of Nigeria.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="A photo with the Prince Momodu Joel Shaka" src="http://i.imgur.com/zH9NwEW.jpg" /></p>

<p>Of course during this year I did a bunch of projects for myself including headphone amps, pre amplifiers, battery chargers, LED lighting, electronic loads, power amplifiers, and a lot more! I&rsquo;ve also been experimenting with DC/DC conversion and power inverters which will be subjects of future blog posts.</p>

<p>One of the most notable projects I&rsquo;ve been working on almost during the entire year is a <a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/battery-capacity" target="_blank">battery capacity database</a> ,which I plan to include all the batteries I can find, and be extremely helpful to determine which battery to buy next or estimate the battery life of your project with a certain battery, I&rsquo;m currently working to create mathematical models of each battery. I&rsquo;m so focused on this project that I&rsquo;ve ditched the old super simple electronic load, which consisted of just a potentiometer, a op-amp, and a power transistor with a data logging multimeter, to a much better, automated, computer-controlled load that I named <a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/miniload" target="_blank">miniload</a>. Discharging batteries now is a lot faster and a lot less problematic.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="miniload" src="http://i.imgur.com/1DAtG55.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is just a bit of what happened when I was away. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m my trip to Dubai starts, I&rsquo;ll be there for the new year celebrations and will be back in the middle of January, so don&rsquo;t go away, there&rsquo;s a lot more to come in 2016! </p>
