<p>For about 2 weeks I&rsquo;ve been having some fun with Linux development, mainly using Ruby to build command-line applications. My decisions, to create command-line applications using Ruby instead of GUI applications, were made because of a simple factor: GUI development for Linux is a nightmare, since there isn&rsquo;t at least one good GUI prototyping tool available to help you design your UI without having to do everything manually.</p>
<p>First I tried <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" target="_blank">Glade</a> which is just a nightmare. It&rsquo;s extremely complicated to deal with and you have no clue about which control you should use or how to arrange things, and most importantly there&rsquo;s not a lot of tutorials and documentation for new users to learn how to use it, and how to integrate with other languages.</p>
<p>Then I was told that <a href="http://qt.digia.com/Product/Developer-Tools/" target="_blank">Qt Creator</a> was an awesome thing, so I decided to give it a try. I&rsquo;ve created a new test project and selected the <a href="http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/qtquick.html" target="_blank">Qt Quick</a> option so I could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML" target="_blank">QML</a>, which is a lot better for a developer with Javascript background like me. One of the things that made me like this was the amount of good documentation and tutorials.</p>
<p>When I started playing with the Designer one of the first things that I noticed was the lack of simple controls like Buttons, this was pretty strange and I thought I haven&rsquo;t installed all the things needed, but when I searched for it <a href="http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/gettingstartedqml.html#basic-component-a-button" target="_blank">I got this tutorial from Qt itself</a>, which explains how to create a button in QML (from scratch!!). QML is one of the most awesome things I ever seen to build the GUI logic, it&rsquo;s simple and flexible, the problem is that there isn&rsquo;t any kind of controls to create real world desktop applications with it.</p>
<p>After that I took a look at <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/" target="_blank">wxWidgets</a>, which lacks good documentation and a decent GUI designer. Then after all this horrible nightmare I thought about creating all my UIs using HTML5 and wrapping everything around a GTK WebKit window, but I don&rsquo;t think this is a good approach since my apps would look like an alien to the system.</p>
<p>Where are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi" target="_blank">Delphi</a>s of modern computing? I remember how easy it was to design UIs using Delphi and with a right-click on the control you could easily attach an event to it&rsquo;s logic. It&rsquo;s this kind of IDE that I&rsquo;m expecting, one that focus on the fact that you don&rsquo;t need to struggle to create a UI, but instead that you should be able to create the UI fast and easily enough, so you can focus on the most important thing that is your application logic.</p>
<p>Linux is a awesome OS, I&rsquo;ve been using it since 2007, and it needs/deserves better tools to create awesome GUI applications, this is one of the reasons that developers aren&rsquo;t porting their apps to Linux. On Mac OS X we have the awesome Xcode that includes a incredibly awesome GUI designer, and on the Windows side we have Visual Studio with a designer that is the best one in my opinion, since it&rsquo;s easy, flexible, and powerful. Isn&rsquo;t this the perfect time for a great Linux GUI designer? </p>
