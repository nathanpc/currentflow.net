<p>I was a bit bored a couple of weeks ago so I decided to design a very simple discrete amplifier rated for 6W/channel just to make sure it would&rsquo;t oscillate and be more confident to build bigger ones.</p>

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s a fairly simple design with a op-amp pre-amplifier and a discrete power amplifier. Building it was extremely simple, the difficult part is always mounting all the panel components and wiring everything.</p>

<p>A while ago I built a program called <a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/build-bom" target="_blank">build-bom</a> to help me quickly find the component values when assembling a board. It&rsquo;s a great use for a old EeePC that you may have laying around.</p>

<p>One thing that you may have noticed is that I&rsquo;ve used canned transistors instead of your typical plastic TO-92. The only reason I did this was because they looked cool and I have a bunch laying around.
