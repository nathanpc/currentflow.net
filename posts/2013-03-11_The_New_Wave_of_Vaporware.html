<p>Last week I got a new development device, a Galaxy Nexus, mainly for Android development since I bricked my old Galaxy S. Sooner or later I would try to install my favorite alpha mobile OS: Firefox OS. I really wanted to try Firefox OS because of how they want HTML5 to be the primary (and unique) way to build applications, but since I <strong>NEVER</strong> run anything on emulators, I was waiting until I had a device that was compatible.</p>

<p>So I went to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS" target="_blank">their docs</a> to get started on how to flash their OS into my Galaxy Nexus. The first thing that I see is that they don&rsquo;t provide binaries, that&rsquo;s not good, but I can compile it myself, no big deal. So I started following their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Building_and_installing_Firefox_OS" target="_blank">Building/Installation entries</a>, installed all the prerequisites, pulled the code from their repo and ran the configure command to prepare the repo. Then I realized it was downloading the Android source code, which is fucking huge and takes an eternity to download, at this point I realized things weren&rsquo;t going to be good.</p>

<p>For some reason they weren&rsquo;t using Google&rsquo;s servers to get Android&rsquo;s code, but instead the shitty Linaro ones, I was getting a extremely unreliable, 60kb/s download, it was a hell. After <strong>4 hours</strong> trying to get all the code it started failing bad and then it wouldn&rsquo;t download the rest anymore, so I went to their IRC channel hoping to get some help, but couldn&rsquo;t get much of it, but what was interesting from the conversation in the IRC is that their primary development target isn&rsquo;t phones, but the shitty emulator.</p>

<p>I can rant about emulator and all that crap for days here, but I prefer not to. So, dear Mozilla, if you want developers to really care about the awesome product that you&rsquo;re building, you should first give us a fast and easy way to install it on our devices.</p>

<p>If you look closer at all these 5th place mobile OSes (Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS, and Tizen) you&rsquo;ll realize one major thing: It looks like they&rsquo;ll never ship (yeah Tizen, you&rsquo;re the worst at the time), they just appear to be a bunch of vaporware.</p>

<p>I really love to see all these emerging technologies and have fun with development stuff, but if I can&rsquo;t install it, I&rsquo;ll just loose my interest and never look back. I think I&rsquo;ll never try Firefox OS again, it was a great experiment, but if you focus on crap emulators I won&rsquo;t support your platform. </p>
