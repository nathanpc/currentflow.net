<p>As I&rsquo;ve described in <a href="/post/2014-05-11/Unbelievable_Prices.html" target="_blank">Unbelievable Prices</a>, I bought a crappy chinese MP3 player to use as a &ldquo;true&rdquo; sound source (instead of the function generator I use while early-testing my audio projects) for testing my audio circuits without having to worry about accidentally shorting 12V into my iPod&rsquo;s headphone jack or something like that while probing around.</p>

<p>Yesterday it arrived and as it was expected, it&rsquo;s the best of Shenzhen. Horrible plastics and build quality, the buttons are super stiff, and overall a shitty product as it was expected to be, but since I&rsquo;m only going to use it for testing, I don&rsquo;t care. Here are some pictures of the &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; thing:

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s a typical chinese product. The LiPo battery has no markings, except for a weird XI logo, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a protected pack and the flimsy wires that connect it to the main board can snap off at any second and short the thing out.</p>

<p>Right next to what looks like the main processor, which sadly I couldn&rsquo;t find any information about it, there&rsquo;s a very nicely heat-shrunk clock crystal. On the center of the board you can see a generic <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm4871.pdf" target="_blank">4871</a> audio power amplifier, and on the left side there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.kingroad-china.net/Uploadfiles/2010763471154996.pdf" target="_blank">BK1080</a> FM receiver IC.</p>

<p>On the other side of the board all you can see is the horrible LCD and the shittiest buttons you can buy in the Shenzhen market. </p>
