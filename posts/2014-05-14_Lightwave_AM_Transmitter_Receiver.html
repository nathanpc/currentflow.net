<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with a very simple and cheap project for wireless transmissions, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank">lightwave</a> AM transmitter and receiver based on <a href="http://www.cheapscience.com/2012/03/voice-led-modulator.html" target="_blank">Scott&rsquo;s design</a>, which was based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvF77YdkzcY" target="_blank">VK2ZAY&rsquo;s design</a>. In my final design I&rsquo;ve increased the base biasing resistors to decrease the size of the coupling capacitor and also used a darlington transistor to get more current gain.</p>

<p>The transmitter is pretty straight forward, the input modulates the current passing by the LED, which modulates the intensity of light, if you&rsquo;ve designed any class A amplifiers in the past you surely know how it works. The receiver is just a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transimpedance_amplifier" target="_blank">transimpedance amplifier</a>, which is amplifying the signal quite a bit (~56x gain) since the transmitter will usually be a bit far from the receiver. You can do the same with a op-amp, but I much prefer a discrete circuit for these simple things.</p>

<p>You can put a buffer stage with a darlington <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_collector" target="_blank">emitter follower</a> on the output of the receiver so you can drive a speaker directly. Something that I would recommend is to add a small (10x gain maybe?) pre-amplifier for the transmitter, that way you&rsquo;ll get a bit more signal if you&rsquo;re source isn&rsquo;t very loud, specially if you want to drive some high power LEDs, since you have a lot of current headroom with those.</p>

<p>If you want to experiment with different values in a simulation, here is the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12174296/Current%20Flow/AM%20Lightwave%20Transmitter%20and%20Receiver.asc" target="_blank">LTspice schematic</a>. The best way to choose the best LED + photodiode combination to maximize the range is to build some breakout boards that you can plug different LEDs and photodiodes until you have the perfect combination.</p>
