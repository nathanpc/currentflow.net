<p>Since I was tired of using the <a href="http://thesignalpath.com/blogs/2011/06/12/camera-flash-circuit-and-nixie-tube-tutorial/" target="_blank">flash circuit hack</a> (<a href="https://plus.google.com/+NathanCampos/posts/f2zAfrbQJmw" target="_blank">my version</a>) to power my tube experiments I finally decided to build a isolation transformer using two identical step-down transformers as suggested by Mike in his <a href="http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/nixclock.html" target="_blank">nixie clock documentation</a>. Here are some photos of it:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planing to build a adjustable HV lab power supply in the future (which I may sell as a kit), so stay tuned. </p>
