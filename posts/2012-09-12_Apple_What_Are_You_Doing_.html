<p>This is my thoughts about the new iPhone that Apple just introduced today. I&rsquo;m writing this as I watch the keynote. (it was written yesterday at night so I decided to publish it today. I haven&rsquo;t reviewed or modified it.)<h1>iPhone 5</h1><h2>The name</h2></p>

<p>Seriously Apple? I really loved that you called the iPad 3 the new iPad, which is a lot better for you and for the people since now most of what you&rsquo;re going to do is just do some iterations like you did from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 4S. Calling it the iPhone 5 makes no sense.<h2>The bigger screen</h2></p>

<p>That looked like a nice addition in the beginning, but it will become a hell. A lot of apps are going to have those crappy bars, could you guys do what Android does and just re-align the pixels? Most of the apps really have no reason to &ldquo;take advantage&rdquo; of that bigger screen. Also that aspect ratio is just the worst one ever. It will also start a little more fragmentation to the platform.<h2>That back</h2></p>

<p>Seriously that back looks like a generic chinese phone back. It is just so ugly. I would prefer if it was made all of the same color/material which would make a lot more sense.<hr /><h1>Stock Apps</h1><h2>Shared Photo Stream</h2></p>

<p>Haha, I had to laugh when I saw this. That&rsquo;s really the worst thing ever. They forgot that today our friends have different devices, usually they are half iOS users and half Android users, also Instagram does this a lot better and in a lot better and more social way.<h2>Siri</h2></p>

<p>Nice new additions to Siri (I&rsquo;m talking about the sports stuff). I hope that&rsquo;s international because if that&rsquo;s only for the USA you just made a stupid decision.<h2>iTunes</h2></p>

<p>The new additions to iTunes were really awesome. The new Mac app UI is really great. I loved the clean interface.<hr /><h1>iPod</h1><h2>The nano</h2></p>

<p>The new iPod nano is really awesome and a lot better than the current generation. If I didn&rsquo;t used my phone as my music player I would buy it for sure. By the way I still can&rsquo;t understand why someone would use the iPod nano to watch a movie or look at photos.<h2>The touch</h2></p>

<p>The back really looks like crap. It&rsquo;s really thin and light, but the only market for that is kind of device is for children that their parents doesn&rsquo;t want to give them a smartphone. Also I had a &ldquo;WTF?!&rdquo; moment when they showed that wrist wrap they are calling iPod touch Loop.<hr /><h1>Conclusion</h1></p>

<p>Sadly Apple haven&rsquo;t got me back. I&rsquo;ll continue to develop for BlackBerry, I think they are doing a better work to innovate with BlackBerry 10. </p>
