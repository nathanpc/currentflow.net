<p>Today I was reading some of the 109 articles saved on my <a href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> account and I thought about something that I would love: A tablet running a fully customized (for stability and lightness) version of Android sporting a awesome e-ink display. As soon as possible I <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/112969911133615369021/posts/RVz3GRHvgw2" target="_blank">posted it on Google+</a>, since I really wanted to philosophize more on this idea I&rsquo;ve wrote this article.</p>

<p><strong>Why e-ink?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if you&rsquo;re going to read for long periods of time the LCD screen is just going to burn your eyes, that&rsquo;s why e-ink is the best alternative. Second, if you ever owned a Kindle (I own the DX, and the new non touch screen version), or any other e-ink device, you know that the experience is incredibly great. I know the refresh rate is a con, but seriously there are a lot more pros and also this technology is still evolving.</p>

<p><strong>What about a touch screen?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe, but I would buy the non-touch screen version because on a reading device I prefer to navigate and switch pages using physical buttons, also be able to holding it anyway I want without worrying about touching the screen by accident.</p>

<p><strong>Why not just root a Nook Simple Touch?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, the Nook Simple Touch <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1346748" target="_blank">can be rooted</a> and turn into a &ldquo;fully functional&rdquo; e-ink Android tablet, the problem is fairly simple: The lack of Android e-ink optimized apps. That&rsquo;s why if a startup start this trend and it gets some attraction of reading addicts I&rsquo;m sure developers of big reading apps for Android will optimize their applications for this new category. Also the interface isn&rsquo;t actually optimized, it&rsquo;s just a lighter version of ADW Launcher with some tweaks, nothing drastically changed from stock Android, and for this kind of screen a UI with more contrast and less mid-tones is a must.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your proposed interface for this device?</strong></p>

<p>This is my sketch of the perfect UI for it, <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper" target="_blank">made with Paper</a> (sorry for my terrible drawing skills):</p>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="UI Sketch" src="http://c15050254.r54.cf2.rackcdn.com/android-eink-sketch.JPG" /></p>

<p>The interface is pretty clean and extremely usable (also it looks a bit with the Kindle interface). The status bar will only show the name of the user and a clock. Below the <em>status bar</em> is the <em>app drawer</em>, I thought about it as just a simple collection of the application names (scrollable if you have more applications than it can fit on the screen). The last piece is the actual running application itself.</p>

<p><strong>There is market for such product?</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult question to answer, but as far as everyone can see the eReader/eBook market is growing exponentially and I think a lot of customers would give it a try if it was presented to them.</p>

<p><strong>What you might end up doing?</strong></p>

<p>As I wait until this dream reading device becomes true I&rsquo;ll buy a Nook Simple Touch, root it, customize the OS to make everything with high contrast, and start developing that launcher from scratch.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts about this dream device? Any suggestions about it? Leave a comment. </p>
