<p><em>I&rsquo;m watching the <a href="http://live.theverge.com/microsoft-live-blog-tablet-announcement/" target="_blank">Microsoft keynote</a> at the same time as I write this, so if I commit any error just put it in the comments.</em></p>

<p>List of problems with the Microsoft Surface:</p>

<ul>
	<li>16:9 aspect ratio</li>
	<li>Confusing products (ARM and Intel)</li>
	<li>No pricing confirmed</li>
</ul>

<p>The 16:9 aspect ratio for a 10&quot; tablet is the worst one you could ever use and still Android manufactures and Microsoft thinks it&rsquo;s a great thing. It&rsquo;s just impossible to feel comfortable with a 10&quot; 16:9 tablet in your hands while in portrait and the same happens for landscape. Every time I get my ASUS Eee Pad Slider to do something I immediately want to go back to my iPad.</p>

<p>Having the same name for completely different products that look exactly the same is the worst thing Microsoft could ever do. They made a professional tablet, using a Intel chip, running Windows 8 Pro (another terrible name) that &ldquo;might be capable&rdquo; of running all those those so called &ldquo;classic&rdquo; applications. And another tablet that looks just the same but with a ARM chip and running Windows RT, and won&rsquo;t be capable of running &ldquo;classic&rdquo; applications, which I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://nathancampos.me/post/17091842348/windows-8-is-already-fragmented" target="_blank">already discussed how it will be a nightmare on a past article</a>.</p>

<p>The last thing that wasn&rsquo;t presented and also haven&rsquo;t talked about is the availability. I&rsquo;m almost sure it won&rsquo;t be available on developing nations like Brazil neither countries that don&rsquo;t have Microsoft Stores.</p>

<p>Anyway I won&rsquo;t be buying one of these because I seriously don&rsquo;t care about Windows anymore, it&rsquo;s boring since Windows Vista and it&rsquo;s still boring, but now it will be a lot worst with all the fragmentation problems that are going to come with the release of Windows 8 and Windows RT.</p>

<p>Some interesting quotes I selected:</p>

<blockquote>We believe that any intersection between human and machine can be made better when hardware and software are considered together.</blockquote>

<p>Looks a lot like the Apple approach huh?</p>

<blockquote>Take the mouse. Windows needed one, so we built one. Early reviews were not very positive &mdash; in fact, it was so new that Canadian customs quarantined it.</blockquote>

<p>I won&rsquo;t comment on this one.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I say perfect a lot &mdash; it&rsquo;s part of our team culture.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>I still remember Windows Vista.. Also that&rsquo;s not part of your team, it&rsquo;s more part of the Apple team.</p>

<blockquote>We took the time to get Surface and Windows 8 right. To do something that was really different and really special. We&rsquo;re proud of the Surface like we&rsquo;re proud of Windows 8. Because of Windows 8, the Surface is a PC, it is a tablet&hellip; it&rsquo;s something new.</blockquote>

<p>Looks like a Transformer Prime running Windows 8 for me&hellip; </p>
