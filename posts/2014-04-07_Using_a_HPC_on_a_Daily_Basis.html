<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started using my <a href="http://www.hpcfactor.com/reviews/hardware/hp/jornada720/" target="_blank">Jornada 720</a> as a replacement for my iPad as a lab computer since it&rsquo;s extremely tiny (space is very important in the bench) and can do practically everything I need my iPad for, of course I still have my main computer in the lab to program microcontrollers and do everything, but the Jornada is great to have near my working area so I can quickly check datasheets, schematics, and parts list while soldering or prototyping.</p>

<p>Usually when I&rsquo;m prototyping or testing a board I have to check datasheets for pinouts, common voltages, etc. and Adobe Reader is great for this task:</p>

<p>In my main computer I keep a very well organized folder (and database, but I&rsquo;m still researching the best way to get the DB into my j720 and keep them both synced) with datasheets for practically every electronic component I have in stock. So whenever I update the folder with more stuff I just <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/" target="_blank">rsync</a> everything to my Jornada, and since it&rsquo;s a nice Linux machine I&rsquo;ve already wrote a nice script to automate things.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, I&rsquo;ve built a small command line application a while ago called <a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/build-bom" target="_blank">build-bom</a> which gets a schematic file from my CAD program (<a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/" target="_blank">EAGLE</a>) and can output the parts list into HTML, CSV, or JSON. So whenever I&rsquo;m populating a board I export the parts list to HTML and open it in my Jornada so I can know which part to place where in the board:</p>
